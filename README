	PDL:PP 

=======================

PDL::PP is a module that programmers can use to generate XSUB
code that interfaces with PDL easily.

Requirements: PDL1.02, perl5.003(_01?)

See the file demo.pl and test.pl for some comments on what
this can be used for.

In the distribution are included also the modules
	PDL::Primitive - some primitive stuff using PDL::PP
	PDL::NBasic - unary and binary operators using PDL::PP
	PDL::Gaussian - objects representing Gaussian functions

See the file TODO for current problems.
