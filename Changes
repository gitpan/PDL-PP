0.010 <= 0.009

Just small cosmetics, lots of bug fixes and a couple of new functions.
Nothing major.

0.009 <= 0.008

Supports type conversion and new PDL creation from null() better.

PDL::Primitive with several interesting functions created

PDL::NBasic expanded and stabilised.

PDL::Gaussian initiated (very incomplete as yet and may not completely
work).

0.008 <= 0.007

New format for Changes -file

NBasic: initial support for generating PDL operators using PDL::PP.
Not yet complete

New types() -syntax

The parser and code generator is once again slightly more object-oriented.

Numerous bug fixes

Started creating HOOK support.

0.006 => 0.007

Started changing error messages to better ones
Some important bug fixes to threading (now $a->thread()) works
with more than one argument (blush).

Thread.pm is included (blush**2)

0.005 => 0.006

Huge number of changes:

- object orientification of code

- threading, implicit and explicit

- Thread.pm, mapping utility functions

- now we require PDL 1.02

- PDLs cannot for the moment be created (sorry about the
  step backwards)

- some more documentation

- demo.pl

0.004 => 0.005

Make it possible to create PDLs on the fly

0.003 => 0.004

Added $P(...) and $TSD(...) syntax for the fortran interface
as well as the ability to specify which types to genericize to
using the TYPES:BSU directive.

0.002 => 0.003

Nothing, made a mistake in uploading to PAUSE.

0.001 => 0.002

Added possibility of having second argument as a semicolon-separated
string.

data a(var,var) should work now with accesses
$a(var0=>foo,var1=>bar)

"Rest" indices now work with "...". "..." is converted to "_DOTS_".

Different datatypes and type coercion: a rudimentary implementation.

PDL::PP now writes also the .pm file automatically.
