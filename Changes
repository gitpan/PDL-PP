Nothing, made a mistake in uploading to PAUSE.

0.001 => 0.002

Added possibility of having second argument as a semicolon-separated
string.

data a(var,var) should work now with accesses
$a(var0=>foo,var1=>bar)

"Rest" indices now work with "...". "..." is converted to "_DOTS_".

Different datatypes and type coercion: a rudimentary implementation.
