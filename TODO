Severe problem: 
type conversions. Currently, if some routine starts converting a map()ed
type, you lose. Badly. The routine should at least barf if the PDL
is a output pdl.

[t],[o] should actually create, except when input explicitly threaded.

Map: negative indices interpreted as from end.

Physical copying & write back?
